# What is SysFlow?

The SysFlow Telemetry Pipeline is a framework for monitoring cloud workloads and for creating performance and security analytics. The goal of this project is to build all the plumbing required for system telemetry so that users can focus on writing and sharing analytics on a scalable, common open-source platform. The backbone of the telemetry pipeline is a new data format called SysFlow, which lifts raw system event information into an abstraction that describes process behaviors, and their relationships with containers, files, and network. This object-relational format is highly compact, yet it provides broad visibility into container clouds. We have also built several APIs that allow users to process SysFlow with their favorite toolkits. Learn more about SysFlow in the [SysFlow specification document](https://sysflow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/spec.html).

# About This Image

This image is the Red Hat OpenShift (OC) Operator for deploying both the SysFlow exporter and collector as pods on openshift platforms.  

# How to use this image

Providing S3 config with environment variables, run `deployAll`:

```
S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<your_acs_key> S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<your_sec_key> S3_HOSTNAME=<e.g. s3.us-south.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud> S3_SYSFLOW_BUCKET=<e.g. sf-monitoring> ./deployAll
```
